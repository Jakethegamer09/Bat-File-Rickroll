The .bat file when executed opens a link to an autoplay rickroll, and the .vbs file opens a popup window that says "boo" and it does not matter if you click ok, or the X to close it, it will continue to popup.
The only way I know of to close the vbs file is in task manager, it will show up as ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15ed01f8-f93c-4b5a-b08a-077caa69d9af)
